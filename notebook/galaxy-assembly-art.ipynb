    "# Galactic Assembly as Abstract Art\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interactive version of a visualisation that I originally made for understanding how galaxies assemble in the evolving Universe of the EAGLE simulations ([Schaye et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446..521S/abstract), [Crain et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.1937C/abstract)). In the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$-CDM) model, the current 'standard' cosmological model, galaxies assemble hierarchically, building their mass over time through the merging of smaller galactic building blocks. In the $\\Lambda$-CDM model, this hierarchical assembly is mainly governed by the distribution of the cold dark matter in the very early universe, itself determined by the details of the events following the Big Bang. The EAGLE simulations simulate these events from just after the Big Bang, right out to the present day in a representative volume of a Universe. This visualisation shows the track of all of the simulation particles which eventually form into a galaxy with a similar mass, shape and size to our galaxy, the Milky Way - a relatively large disc galaxy. \n",
    "\n",
    "These events are commonly visualised through [movies](https://vimeo.com/93020498), which focus on the galaxy forming in the simulations, showing its formation at each simulation snapshot. By instead showing the position of all the particles which make a galaxy in one frame, we see a different side of galaxy evolution, exposing the importance of hierarchical assembly in forming the galaxies we observe in the Universe today. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bold streak of tracks through the center of the field belongs to the main progenitor of the final galaxy, formed from a large overdense region of gas and dark matter, early in the evolution of the simulation. The mass of this early progenitor acts as a magnet, sucking up gas and attracting smaller early galaxies with its gravitational pull. Meanwhile, other, large overdensities undergo the same process, becoming galaxies of nearly comparable size to the main galaxy. These too are pulled in, but are dragged in much more gradually, having gained angular momentum during their own formation. These loop around the main 'branch', forming coil-like patterns in the visualisation. Eventually, they merge onto the main galaxy, and they become one.\n",
    "\n",
    "By toggling the dark matter particles in the visualisation, the fundamental role of this hidden component of our universe is laid bare. The Baryons (stars and gas) follow the dark matter to their fate as galaxies, and the exact properties of the dark matter affect the eventual outcome of the simulations. By using simulations like EAGLE to understand galaxy formation, we may be able to make predictions for the nature of dark matter which will aid in its detection and characterisation in the real Universe."
